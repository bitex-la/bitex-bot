  # Simulates hitting an order-book to find a price at which an order can be assumed to get executed completely.
  # It essentially drops the start of the order book, to account for price volatility (assuming those orders may be taken by
  # someone else), and then digs until the given QUOTE_CURRENCY amount or BTC quantity are reached, finally returning
  # the last price seen, which is the 'safest' price at which we can expect this order to get executed quickly.

  class OrderBookSimulator
    # @param volatility [Integer] How many seconds of recent volume we need to skip from the start of the order book to be more
    #   certain that our order will get executed.
    # @param transactions [Hash] a list of hashes representing all transactions in the other exchange:
    #    Each hash contains 'date', 'tid', 'price' and 'amount', where 'amount' is the BTC transacted.
    # @param order_book [[price, quantity]] a list of lists representing the order book to dig in.
    # @param amount_target [BigDecimal] stop when this amount has been reached, leave as nil if looking for a quantity_target.
    # @param quantity_target [BigDecimal] stop when this quantity has been reached, leave as nil if looking for an
    #   amount_target.
    # @return [Decimal] Returns the price that we're more likely to get when executing an order for the given amount or
    #   quantity.
